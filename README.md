## 🔐 Authentication and database migration

The app uses Supabase Auth. Enable the email provider and email confirmation in
Supabase before allowing users to create accounts. Before deploying the new
login, create or invite existing users in Supabase Auth using the same email
addresses stored in the application's `usuario` fields, then have them set a
new password. Apply the migration
`supabase/migrations/20261105100000_supabase_auth_rls.sql` before deploying the
app: it removes the legacy password login, drops the old password column, and
limits each data row to its authenticated owner.

Existing data is linked to Supabase accounts by email when the migration runs.
Rows without a matching Auth account are retained but remain inaccessible until
they are linked by an administrator.

## 📱 Deployment

Build the application for production:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
